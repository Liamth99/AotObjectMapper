<PageTitle>Basic Mapper</PageTitle>

<p>For a basic mapper, all you need is a GenerateMapper and one or more Map&lt;TSource, TDestination&gt; attributes on a partial class.</p>

<p>Below is an example mapper that converts a User to a UserDto.</p>

<Markdown>
```csharp
[GenerateMapper]
[Map&lt;User, UserDto&gt;]
public partial class UserMapper;
```
</Markdown>

<p>When the project is built, the mapper will generate a static Map method on UserMapper which will map Id, FirstName, MiddleName and LastName.</p>

<p>The remaining members cannot be mapped automatically because they differ in type and/or name, or do not exist on one of the classes.</p>

<p>Multiple Map attributes can be added to a single mapper class:</p>

<Markdown>
```csharp
[GenerateMapper]
[Map&lt;User, UserDto&gt;, Map&lt;UserDto, User&gt;]
public partial class UserMapper;
```
